Ocean Tools
=============
This repository contains oceanographic data analysis tools.


Modules
-------

* GM: functions for applying the Garrett and Munk internal wave spectra.
* TKED_parameterisations: functions for estimating turbulent kinetic energy dissipation from finescale observations. Including the finescale parameterisation, Thorpe scale estimates and the large eddy method.
* gravity_waves: linear inertia-gravity wave dynamics.
* sandwell: read data from the Smith and Sandwell bathymetric binary file into a numpy array efficiently.
* utils: miscellaneous functions.
* window: functions for splitting data into chunks.

All very much a work in progress.
